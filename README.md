Midje Quickstart
================

Annotated (tutorialized) projects to help you get started
with [Midje](https://github.com/marick/Midje).

Getting Started
------------

1.  Download
    [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen). For
    the moment, these tutorials assume Leiningen 1, not the
    forthcoming Leiningen 2.

2. To learn more about Leiningen, what it does, and how it
   structures projects, read (or skim) the tutorial:

     `lein help tutorial`

    (Note that the tutorial on the Leiningen website
    describes Leiningen 2, unlike the one `lein` prints.)

2.  Add the `lein midje` command, which you will use to run
     tests:

     `lein plugin install lein-midje 1.0.9`

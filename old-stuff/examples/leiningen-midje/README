This shows the use of a Midje plugin for Leiningen. It's in
the file leiningen/midje.clj

You run it like this:

% lein midje

As with `lein test`, you can give namespace arguments to
check only particular namespaces.

`lein midje` checks both the `test` and `src` directories.

It will also run clojure.test deftests if any exist.

easiest way to try out Midje?

  If you're on Unix (including the Mac), the shell script <code>run</code> runs the tests:
  </p>

  <pre>
     % run
  </pre>

  <p>
  If you're on Windows, you can look at the contents of the
  script (two lines) and translate them into Windows terms.
  </p>

  <p>
    The file in this folder called
  <code>run-expected-output</code> shows what
  the results should look like.

     To download and install everything you need to
     run the example, including Midje, type this:
  </p>
  <pre>
     % lein deps
  </pre>
  <p>
    The downloaded jar files are put in the
    <code>lib/</code> subdirectory.
  </p>

    The file
    <code>test/basic/core_test.clj</code> is
    intended to be good documentation of the different ways
    you can use <code>midje.sweet</code>. You can run
    the tests like this:
  </p>
  <pre>
     % lein midje
  </pre>
  <p>
  The file in this directory called
  <code>lein-expected-output</code> shows what
  the results should look like.

basic/
   Various tests that show the use of Midje's default "sweet" interface.

cake-midje/
   An example of running Midje tests with Cake.

compound-checkers/
   Writing checkers that check more than one thing. (The
   tricky bit is getting the line numbers to come out

leiningen-midje/
    The Midje plugin for leiningen
